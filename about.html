        <p>When I started this module, web development was almost completely
            new to me so at first it was a bit difficult and almost everything I did required
            a bit of research, however I have now wrapped my head around the basics. As for CSS
            the same thing happened, but with practice I have been able to improve my skills
            greatly and can now comfortably create a simple webpage. I was pleased with myself when
            we started using JavaScript as I quickly got the hand of it and found it easier than getting
            started with html and CSS, this is probably down to the fact I have programmed quite a lot in
            the past compared to doing almost no web development. The worksheets have allowed me to gain
            a real insight into how a webpage is created and have also made me want to learn more about it to
            create much more advanced sites in the future, I have already purchased my own domain and plan to make
            a more advanced site that will show my web development skills and also show off my other projects.</p>
