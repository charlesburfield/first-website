	<h1>CS11010: Writing some JavaScript</h1>

	<p>This page is intended to help you with practical 4: JavaScript and forms.
	It is not assessed directly in itself, but if you work your way through the examples here, you will find the assessed practical easier.</p>

	<p>The scripts in this page may not work as you expect.
	You probably want to customise to your own taste anyway!</p>

	<p>The most important thing is that you make sure you understand 
	each script.</p>

	<hr />
	<p>
	The first script is called when the body loads. Can you customise
	it so that it prompts you for your name, then welcomes you
	personally? (we saw the <code>prompt</code> command in the lectures)</p>

	<hr />
	<p>Today is
	<script>
<!-- // ======== Script 2: Dates and numbers as strings ======================
		Today = new Date();
		document.write(Today.getDate() + "/" + (Today.getMonth() + 1) + "/" + Today.getFullYear());
		// Hint: remember what we said about types in JavaScript and
		// the overloading of the + operator
		// Remember also what we said about the Y2K bug
		// -->
	</script>
	</p>
	<p>Is this correct? If not, see if you can fix it!</p>

    <p>
        <script>
            <!-- // ======== Script 4: Time of day ======================
                    let currentT = new Date();
                    let hours = currentT.getHours();
                    
                    if(hours >= 0 && hours < 12){
                        document.write("good morning");
                    } else if (hours >= 12 && hours < 18){
                        document.write("good afternoon");
                    } else if (hours >= 18 && hours < 21){
                        document.write("good evening");
                    } else if (hours >= 21 && hours < 0){
                        document.write("good night");
                    }
                    // -->
        </script>
    </p>
    <p> Can you add in a script here to write "good morning", 
        "good afternoon" or "good evening", as appropriate? Use the 
        same idea as above for the date.
    </p>

	<p>The following is an example of processing input to an HTML form
	using JavaScript. See if you can modify this to be a two-way exchange
	rate calculator.</p>

	<form>
		<p>
		Add VAT to how much?
		<input type="text" name="amount" size="7" />
		</p>
		<p>
		<input type="button" name="calc" onclick="calc_vat()" value="Calculate" />
		</p>
		<p>
		The total price to pay is
		<input type="text" name="result" size="7" />
		</p>
	</form>
